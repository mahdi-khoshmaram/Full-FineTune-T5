## Overview  
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for full fine-tuning the **T5** large language model on the [DialogSum dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/knkarthick/dialogsum).

The notebook demonstrates two fine-tuning approaches:  
1. Fine-tuning with the ü§ó **Transformers Trainer**  
2. Fine-tuning using **native PyTorch**
